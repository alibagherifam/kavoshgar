Kavoshgar is a Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) for JVM written in Kotlin.

As a demo, I also developed a LAN messenger on top of it for both Android and Desktop using KMP.

## SSDP

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol):

> "The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol based on the
> Internet protocol suite for advertisement and discovery of network services and
> presence information. It accomplishes this without assistance of server-based
> configuration mechanisms, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or
> Domain Name System (DNS), and without special static configuration of a network host."

In simple words, giving a network with a couple of nodes, some of them can decide to become a server
and, other nodes (i.e., clients) will be notified about the presence of servers.

## Usage

Only the network nodes you want to be a server should start advertising presence information:

```kotlin
val server = KavoshgarServer(name = "Test Server")
server.advertisePresence()
```

All other network nodes are clients by default and should start discovering available servers:

```kotlin
val client = KavoshgarClient()
client.startServerDiscovery().collect { server ->
    println("Server discovered: ${server.addressName}")
}
```

## ‚ñ∂ Demo

This repository contains a demo application built on top of Kavoshgar to showcase its features and
usage. It is a LAN messenger that you can chat with anybody on the same network. The application
supports both Android and Desktop platforms using Compose Multiplatform:

- [Android Demo](https://github.com/alibagherifam/kavoshgar/tree/master/demo/android)
- [Desktop Demo](https://github.com/alibagherifam/kavoshgar/tree/master/demo/desktop)

## ‚öô Technologies

The project is based on socket programming.

Other technologies used in demo applications:

- Kotlin Coroutines
- Kotlin Multiplatform
- Compose Multiplatform
- Material 3
- AndroidX Lifecycle
- Version Catalog

## üí° Inspiration

This was the final project for the Internet Engineering course during my B.Sc. in Computer
Engineering. I was curious about how in LAN multiplayer video
games ([Counter-Strike](https://blog.counter-strike.net), for example), players join a lobby and
start playing the game without knowing each other's network address. And it took me to the SSDP.
