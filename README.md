Kavoshgar is a Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) written in Kotlin.

As a demo, I also developed a LAN messenger on top of it.

## SSDP

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol):

> "The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol based on the 
> Internet protocol suite for advertisement and discovery of network services and 
> presence information. It accomplishes this without assistance of server-based 
> configuration mechanisms, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or 
> Domain Name System (DNS), and without special static configuration of a network host."

In simple words, giving a network with a couple of nodes, some of them can decide to 
become a server and, other nodes (i.e., clients) will be notified about the presence of servers.

## Usage

Every node on the network (which is a client by default) should start discovering
available servers:

```kotlin
    val client = KavoshgarClient()
    service.startDiscovery()
```

You can collect discovered servers as follow:

```kotlin
    client.discoveredServerFlow().collect { serverInfo ->
        println("Discovered a server:${serverInfo.address}")
    }
```

On the other hand, only the nodes you want to be a server in the network should 
be start replying to client discoveries:

```kotlin
    val server = KavoshgarServer(name = "Test Server")
    server.startDiscoveryReplying()
```

## ‚ñ∂ Demo

Kavoshgar comes with a demo application. It is a LAN messenger that you can chat with 
anybody on the same network. The application is built on top of Kavoshgar to showcase 
its usage and features. Currently, only Android version of the messenger is available, but 
I am developing a desktop version using Kotlin multiplatform. So stay tuned ;)

## ‚öô Technologies

The project is based on socket programming.

Other technologies used in demo application:

- Kotlin Coroutines
- Jetpack Compose
- AndroidX Lifecycle
- Version Catalog
- Coil

## üí° Inspiration

This was the final project for the Internet Engineering course during my 
B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. I was curious about how in multiplayer 
video games ([Dota2](https://www.dota2.com), for example), players join a lobby 
and start playing the game without knowing each other's network address. 
And it took me to the SSDP.
